# GFlow v 4.0

## Getting Started 

Fourth generation of the granular flow simulator.

This generation was heavily inspired by LAMMPS, GROMACS, OpenMD, etc. to make improvements to the program structure. For example, most objects inherit from a base class that has pointers to the GFlow simulation object and all of its main objects (inspired by LAMMPS).
